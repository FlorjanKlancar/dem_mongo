At the top left corner we can see our currently equiped hero. At the moment it's the default one which doesn't give you any bonuses. Below the main menu you can see your resources storage and also the Warehouse/Granary max capacity which is larger every time you upgrade one of them. Below the resources bar it's the resources fields. Your production per hour gets higher everytime you upgrade one of them as well. By upgrading resources field/building you use your worker capacity which is 1 at the moment, meaning that you can upgrade only one field/building at the time.

### Upgrade modal
