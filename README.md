## Information

### Main page of the browser game.

At the top left corner we can see our currently equiped hero. At the moment it's the default one which doesn't give you any bonuses. Below the main menu you can see your resources storage and also the Warehouse/Granary max capacity which is larger every time you upgrade one of them. Below the resources bar it's the resources fields. Your production per hour gets higher everytime you upgrade one of them as well. By upgrading resources field/building you use your worker capacity which is 1 at the moment, meaning that you can upgrade only one field/building at the time.

### Upgrade modal

Here you can see upgrade level information (Field name, field description, resources cost for upgrading etc.)

### Upgrade in progress

Here you can see your field/building is being upgraded, you can cancel this build meaning it will not refund your resources but it will cancel current build.
Or you can finish it immediately by paying in zil.

### Statistics page

This is Hero inventory page, here you can equip your NFT's (heros or weapons) to give you extra bonuses such as Energy recharge which will be used for queing up or extra attack/defense...

### Roadmap for the future

Create a token on the zilliqa blockchain, and use this token for the in-game payments and rewards. </br>
Create a upgrade Weapons mechanism with combining the metadata of previous NFT's. </br>
Expand the game functionality (add clans, clan rewards, map, add npc's, ...)
